# Python Exercises

This is a personal repo for working through problem sets from my Udemy Python class or other fun exercises that I find on the interwebs. 

## Environment setup 

I use `venv` and `pip` to manage my very simple environment. 

I'm using `Python 3.7.2` unless otherwise noted. 

To install the environment: 

* Run `python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment`
* Activate the environment: `source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/activate`
* Pip install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
